I began meditating when I was eight years old. I lived near Mt. Spokane and had free range of Deadman's Creek. Fishing with a pole made from a maple branch, I found myself focusing on a small whirlpool in a creek, patiently waiting for fish to bite. My mind observed my thoughts. I tried not to catch those thoughts as I was attempting to catch a fish. What I caught as well as fish was the ability to watch my mind without attachment.

I eventually found myself on the shores of Lake Union in Seattle, living a bohemian life. I began practicing yoga, meditating, and studying Zen and other Eastern systems, having studied philosophy at WSU, and a variety of liberal arts at the UW. I continued my interest in the mind, reading popular psychology and books that were often pressed on me by my friends. I began drawing and painting and, continued writing poetry, an art Iâ€™d begun in high school. The object of my artistic endeavors was to explore my interior. This became my preferred form of meditation.

In 1966 I had a revelation that I would no longer take a job unless I enjoyed it. The very next job lasted two days. I immensely enjoyed being fired. After that, the world opened up. I found a job with a commercial sculptor making brass and copper trees, plastic trees, and other " abstract" pieces.

Al Hansen's art was beautiful if not technically fine art. I worked off and on with him for nearly ten years. I learned a lot from him. At the same time, I absorbed art skills from artist friends, books, observation, and practice. I continued to read voraciously and wrote poetry often.

I became an adult in the 1960's. I grew up between the beats and the hippies. Consciousness expansion and developing a vital internal life, were priorities for me. Developing a spiritual path was also important. Somewhere along this journey, I rediscovered the joy I experienced as a child. Many experiences, wonderful friends, books, conversations, and ideas led me to living life in joyous manner. I eventually understood that joy was a goal, a path, a way to cope with an imperfect and often cruel world. Cultivating joy includes striving for peace,love, and understanding. It is a worthy pursuit.

I am fortunate that I have had a secure and loving childhood and a guardian spirit that has provided so many wonderful experiences to me. A spirit guide entered my life in 1968. She is a spirit venerated by the Salish people of many tribes. To the Swinomish, she is the spirit of abundance. She chose me, and I eventually accepted her. She has brought an abundance of everything I need or desire. She also led me into a practice of Shamanism. In one form or another I have practiced shamanism for forty years.

I have been a practicing energetic healer for over fifteen years, and I continue to meditate, practice shamanism, write, and create in many mediums on a daily basis.
